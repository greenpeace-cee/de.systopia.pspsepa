# CiviSEPA PSP

This extension utilises the workflow of SEPA Direct Debit payments to keep
track of payment contracts with external payment service providers and therefore
extends the
[CiviSEPA extension](https://github.com/project60/org.project60.sepa).

Payment requests can be sent to the PSP depending on payment contract data as
managed by CiviSEPA.

## Supported PSP

Currently, the following payment service providers (PSP) are supported:
- Adyen
